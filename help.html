    <p><strong>🧠Understanding the Dashboard:</strong> This tool scans third-party contracts for cybersecurity controls.</p>
    <p><strong>🛠️Working with Legal & Vendors:</strong> Use suggestions to request missing controls or clarifications.</p>
    <p><strong>📚Compliance Frameworks:</strong> Learn about ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR, and PCI-DSS below.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>How to Interpret the Results</h2>
  <ul>

    <li>Each scanned contract is evaluated for compliance with critical cybersecurity controls.</li>
    <li>Mismatches are flagged by severity: 🔴 High, 🟠 Medium.</li>
    <li>The compliance score (0–100) shows how well the contract aligns with best practices.</li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  <h2>Working with Legal / Vendors</h2>
<ul>
  <li>💬Talk to your Legal or Procurement team about updating the contract language.</li>
  <p>If the scan finds missing clauses or non-compliant language (e.g., no mention of encryption or access controls), bring it to the attention of your Legal or Procurement team. They can help interpret the risk and may suggest rewording the contract or adding necessary security clauses to align with internal policies and compliance frameworks.</p>

  <li>📨Ask the vendor for clarification or an amendment confirming compliance.</li>
  <p>Sometimes the vendor does follow good security practices, but the contract just doesn’t clearly reflect it. Reach out to the vendor and ask for clarification. If needed, request a written amendment or addendum confirming compliance with specific standards (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR, etc.).</p>
  <li>🛠️Use the <strong>Suggestions</strong> in each contract card to guide what to request.</li>
  <p>Use suggestions as a guide when drafting updated contract terms or requests. For example, if encryption is missing, the suggestion might say: " Enforce strong encryption for data at rest and in transit using standards like AES-256 or RSA-2048." You can forward that directly to your legal or vendor contacts.</p>
</ul>

<br>
  <h2>How to Act on Non-Compliance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Review top failed controls and reasons.</li>
    <li>Use the provided suggestions to update contract terms or request clarification from vendors.</li>
    <li>Engage your Legal or Vendor Management team to enforce necessary changes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cybersecurity Frameworks & How to Comply</h2>

  <div class="framework">
    <button class="collapsible">📘 ISO 27001 (Information Security Management)</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>ISO 27001 is a globally recognized standard that helps organizations establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve an information security management system (ISMS). For third-party suppliers, being ISO 27001 compliant proves that they have a structured approach to protecting sensitive data, managing risks, and responding to incidents. It builds trust with clients by showing a proactive commitment to securing information assets, especially when handling customer or business-critical data.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Comply:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Define an organization-wide security policy.</li>
        <li>Conduct regular risk assessments and enforce mitigation strategies.</li>
        <li>Establish access control, encryption, and incident response procedures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example Clause:</strong> “The vendor must maintain an ISMS aligned with ISO/IEC 27001 standards.”</p>

  <div class="framework">
    <button class="collapsible">🔐 NIST Cybersecurity Framework</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides guidelines and best practices for identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity threats. Third-party suppliers that follow NIST controls demonstrate a strong cybersecurity posture aligned with U.S. government standards. This is particularly important for vendors supporting federal agencies or critical infrastructure. It helps suppliers align with risk-based security practices and makes it easier for larger enterprises to assess and trust their security readiness.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Comply:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify critical systems and assets.</li>
        <li>Implement technical safeguards (e.g., access control, logging, encryption).</li>
        <li>Respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example Clause:</strong> “The supplier shall implement controls aligned with NIST SP 800-53 to ensure system integrity.”</p>

  <div class="framework">
    <button class="collapsible">🌍 GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>GDPR is a European Union regulation focused on data privacy and protection for individuals. It’s especially important for third-party suppliers that handle or process personal data of EU citizens, regardless of where the supplier is located. Compliance with GDPR shows that a vendor respects data subject rights, uses transparent data practices, and has safeguards in place to protect personal information. Non-compliance can lead to massive fines and reputational damage, making it critical for suppliers in any data processing role.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Comply:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Obtain valid consent before processing personal data.</li>
        <li>Minimize data collection and specify retention periods.</li>
        <li>Ensure processors and sub-processors comply with GDPR obligations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example Clause:</strong> “The vendor shall process personal data solely as per the instructions of the data controller and comply with GDPR Articles 28 and 32.”</p>

  <div class="framework">
    <button class="collapsible">💳 PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>PCI-DSS is a global standard for organizations that store, process, or transmit credit card data. Third-party suppliers involved in payment processing, e-commerce, or IT infrastructure must comply to protect cardholder data from breaches and fraud. For suppliers, being PCI-DSS compliant reduces liability, increases customer trust, and is often a prerequisite for partnering with financial or retail companies. It demonstrates a commitment to secure payment environments and protecting financial data.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Comply:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use firewalls and strong access controls.</li>
        <li>Encrypt stored and transmitted cardholder data.</li>
        <li>Perform regular security testing and audits.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example Clause:</strong> “All cardholder data shall be stored, transmitted, and processed in accordance with PCI-DSS v4.0 requirements.”</p>
